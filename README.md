# PAHDecomp

## Overview
PAHDecomp is a tool for modelling mid-infrared spectra of galaxies based on the popular PAHFIT code (Smith+07). Unlike PAHFIT this model decomposes the continuum into a star-forming component and an obscured nuclear component based on Bayesian priors on the shape of the star-forming component (using templates + prior on extinction). This makes this tool ideally suited for modelling the spectra of heavily obscured galaxies.
